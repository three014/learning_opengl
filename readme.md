Basic Graphics Project for Windows

I'm building for Windows but developing on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS)

# Dependencies for this project:
- glfw 3.3.8 for Windows (64-bit pre-compiled binaries)
- MinGW-w64 - gcc and g++
- cmake 3.16.3 or higher
- Glad OpenGL Loader (Core, Version 3.3) 
  - Should be included already in include/ and src/
- I'll add more to this list as I remember

# Steps to get up and running:
1. 
2. Clone repository
3. Download glfw binaries and place in project folder
4.
